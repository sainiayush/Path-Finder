## Features

1. Developed an interactive interface supporting both touch and pen input for seamless user experience.
2. Optimized the application for smooth performance on low-end mobile devices and tablets.
3. Implemented a responsive design for compatibility across different screen sizes and devices.
4. Integrated a wide range of both basic and advanced pathfinding algorithms for various use cases.
5. Designed an extensible API, enabling users to easily implement and test their own custom pathfinding algorithms.
6. Incorporated multiple execution modes (Fast, Medium, Slow, Step-by-Step) to enhance algorithm comprehension.
7. Created a fully customizable grid system with options to adjust colors, execution speed, and control execution flow (Pause, Resume, Stop).
